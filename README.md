# BoBo's BIG Adventure!

This is a picture book. Please have fun with it and enjoy the story!

## STORY MOVED

Due to the deprecation of `create-react-app`, I've recreated the book as a template in Next.js. I will be archiving this project to avoid confusion. Please check it out [here](https://github.com/ig-ealbert/childrens-book-template).

This project should still work if you're really all-in on this repo.

## Prerequisites

This project uses React, which is a Javascript library. This means you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. The latest LTS version is recommended.

Since you're looking at a project on GitHub, you'll need to have the [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed too.

## How to View the Book

### Installation (First Time Only)

Open Git Bash and clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ig-ealbert/bobos-big-adventure.git
```

Install the dependencies.

```bash
cd bobos-big-adventure
npm install
```

### Running the Project (Each Time)

```
npm start
```

## Paging

Use the `<` and `>` buttons to navigate the pages of the book!

## How was this made?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
